1,SWIEHF3EF5PZAZUY,8/8/2015,5,"I initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing: the paperwhite is great, but if you have spending money, go for the voyage.Fortunately, I had friends who owned each, so I ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis: both models now have 300 ppi, so the 80 dollar jump turns out pricey the voyage's page press isn't always sensitive, and if you are fine with a specific setting, you don't need auto light adjustment).It's been a week and I am loving my paperwhite, no regrets! The touch screen is receptive and easy to use, and I keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day. (In any case, it's not hard to change the setting either, as you'll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day, not every now and then while reading).Also glad that I went for the international shipping option with Amazon. Extra expense, but delivery was on time, with tracking, and I didnt need to worry about customs, which I may have if I used a third party shipping service."
2,SWIEHF3EF5PZAZUY,9/1/2015,5,"Allow me to preface this with a little history. I am (was) a casual reader who owned a Nook Simple Touch from 2011. I've read the Harry Potter series, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, 1984, Brave New World, and a few other key titles. Fair to say my Nook did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs.Fast forward to today. I have had a full week with my new Kindle Paperwhite and I have to admit, I'm in love. Not just with the Kindle, but with reading all over again! Now let me relate this review, love, and reading all back to the Kindle. The investment of 139.00 is in the experience you will receive when you buy a Kindle. You are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from Amazon.I have been reading The Hunger Games trilogy and shall be moving onto the Divergent series soon after. Here is the thing with the Nook that hindered me for the past 4 years: I was never inspired to pick it up, get it into my hands, and just dive in. There was never that feeling of oh man, reading on this thing is so awesome. However, with my Paperwhite, I now have that feeling! That desire is back and I simply adore my Kindle. If you are considering purchasing one, stop thinking about it simply go for it. After a full week, 3 downloaded books, and a ton of reading, I still have half of my battery left as well.Make yourself happy. Inspire the reader inside of you."
3,SWIEHF3EF5PZAZUY,7/20/2015,4,I am enjoying it so far. Great for reading. Had the original Fire since 2012. The Fire used to make my eyes hurt if I read too long. Haven't experienced that with the Paperwhite yet.
4,SWIEHF3EF5PZAZUY,6/16/2017,5,"I bought one of the first Paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and I suppose Ive read, on average, a book every three days for the past however many years on it. I wouldnt give it up youd have to pry it from my cold dead fingers.For sundry logistical reasons, Ive also made good use of Amazons Kindle app on my iPhone. No Paperwhite screen, naturally, and all the cool usability that delivers, but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the Kindle.Of course, there are aspects of the Paperwhite which I would like to critique. Ah you knew that was coming somewhere, didnt you.As a member of BookBub, I get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres. I take on many of them, however, Ive found that, even with the best will in the world, I cant keep up. Some days it seems that for every book I read, Ive bought two. Theres just so much good stuff out there! The accumulative effect of this is that the number of books actually on my Paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time. Its now at about 400.With this in mind, Ive noticed that while page-turning has remained exactly the same, just about every other action on the Kindle has become positively glacial. Not just very slow, but so slow you think its malfunctioning. The general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a Kindle, it will begin to behave in a flakey manner. This drives me mad. Amazon states it can hold thousands of books. I believe them. But I figure I would need a second Paperwhite to read while Im waiting for actions to complete on the first one.Read more"
5,SWIEHF3EF5PZAZUY,8/11/2016,5,"I have to say upfront - I don't like coroporate, hermetically closed stuff like anything by Apple or in this case, Amazon. I like having devices on which I can put anything I want and use it. But...I was a fairly happy user of a Nook Touch for several years, but couldn't use all its functionalities since I live in Serbia. Then I lost the Nook and since no other devices can actually be fully used in Serbia (buying books with them, using their online capabilities) except the Kindle, and since no one except Amazon ships to Serbia, and since I've actually been a happy Amazon customer since 2005 over friends' accounts and since 2007 through my own, and since the Kindle definitely has the best technology - why not buy itSo I did. What I read in many reviews about the screen/light of the Paperwhite and similar devices was no problem with mine. The light disperses just fine, except a few black blotches (maybe you can see it in the picture) at the bottom of the screen, which are actually shadows of the black plastic casing and thus can't really be avoided. As you can see in the picture without the light - there are no blotches with light out.The Paperwhite's screen is just marvelous at 300 ppi, the touchscreen works just fine, the store works here in Serbia, and in these two days I've been using it, I'm a happy guy.I had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded books behave at least almost like Amazon books, but that's fine. That's the one thing I'd like to see Amazon do in some future upgrades: make the Kindle treat sideloaded books just like the ones bought from them directly, with sharing funcion (quotes and Goodreads) enabled and so on.The size is perfect, it sits very well in the hand, the light doesn't hurt the eyes in the dark (like the light on a tab does)... the packaging was fine, no problems there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life.So far, I can only recommend it."
6,SWIEHF3EF5PZAZUY,7/8/2015,3,"My previous kindle was a DX, this is my second kindle in years. Love the form factor and all but I do miss the physical buttons for page turning. There is a glitch in the software though. I use the English interface but occasionally I would like to translate words into traditional Chinese. However, it seems that the traditional Chinese characters cannot display correctly and become small boxes. The simplified Chinese characters can be displayed correctly though."

8,BOTEGYTZ2T6WUJMM,7/3/2015,4,"Just got mine right now. Looks the same as the previous generation except for the Kindle logo (it's black this time), feels a little heavier, the screen is a little warmer toned than the previous one, BUT the resolution is SO MUCH BETTER! The 300 ppi are definitely obvious and the new font is worth the money.Totally recommend it for a book lover!I'll give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I am used to a cooler screen, but I'm sure I'll get used to this one soon too :)"
9,BOTEGYTZ2T6WUJMM,8/8/2015,4,"As reviewed by the wife This is the perfect thing for a new mommy who loves to read books! As soon as I had my baby girl, I had to stop reading my novels because I had to give the baby my full attention. But how much time do I spend laying in bed, on my side, with the baby while she feeds Especially prior to 4 months when feeding took as long as 45 minutes! Not to mention cluster feeds during growth spurts! A book was out of the question because it's sooo tiring to hold up in side-lying-breastfeeding-position. My new Kindle was the solution! It's light, easy to disinfect (I use baby wipes on the case whenever I feel like it's not clean enough to go on the bed with the baby) and you don't need to keep a finger in the middle of the pages to keep it from closing - you know what I mean!And for some reason it's much easier to go through a book with a Kindle compared to an actual book. I never thought I'd be converted into the Kindle culture but here we are!"
10,BOTEGYTZ2T6WUJMM,7/20/2015,3,"My new Kindle Paperwhite came from the USA to a small town in Sweden in just five days. Payment of tax and customs handled by Amazon. Had not the UPS been so square (they think everyone sits at home all day) I had received it a day earlier.I am very pleased with the e-reader, easy on the eyes, and comfortable to hold in one hand. Even if I buy many books from Amazon I also want to read books in the ePub format. A positive surprise was how easy it is to convert ePub format to Amazon's own format. I use the program Calibre and then I just send the book as an attachment in an e-mail to my Kindle. Quick and easy!"
11,BOTEGYTZ2T6WUJMM,7/1/2015,4,"Had older model, that you could text to speech, this one hasn't. Liked the smaller size, but having to buy a different cover! Still getting used to shelf quite different from my 4 year old model.Paper white is nice reading."
12,BOTEGYTZ2T6WUJMM,8/5/2015,5,"This is a review of the Kindle Paperwhite launched July 2015. Essentially. the same as the previous Kindle Paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded (300 dpi) screen, more memory and storage it's a terrific reading device. This review aims to describe both this product, and compare it with the other Kindle devices available to help you choose the best one for you.Before I start, Ive noticed several complains about Kindle not supporting the ePub format used by Canadian public libraries. Dont be put off, theres a solution in the Frequently Asked Questions section below.This review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits. If youre in a hurry Ive included a summary at the start, and a Frequently Asked Questions section at the end.Summary - What can you do with it-----------------------------------------* Read a book. It can store 1,000s of books - take an entire library away with you on holiday.* Buy a book. You can browse the Amazon kindle store, and buy books over a WIFI connection* Borrow a book. Using the Kindle Owners Library you can borrow one of 60,000 books (if you have Amazon Prime Membership)* Share your books. Using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family* Highlight a section. Using the touch screen, you can highlight a particulary interesting few lines. If several people highlight the same section, that's also indicated.* Record a bookmark. To come back to it later* Read a book on your Kindle, continue on your smartphone or tablet computer, and it will jump to your last known position* Look up a word, and record them in the vocabulary builder* Track a characters appearance throughout a book using the X Ray feature.* Read for weeks without needing to recharge - typically 4-6 weeks* Share you books (Multiple Kindles on the same account, or family sharing)* Access every book you've ever owned on the cloud - available for download within seconds over WIFI or 3G..What Devices are available--------------------------------As of July 2015, Amazon have the following Kindle devices on sale:-1. Kindle 6 (around CDN 79)2. Kindle Paperwhite 6th Generation (212 dpi - launched October 2013) - around CDN 1292. New Kindle Paperwhite 7th Gen (300 dpi - launched July 2015) - around CDN 139-2093. Kindle Voyger - around US 219-289 (Doesnt seem to be on sale in Amazon Canada)4. Kindle Fire - 6 or 7 colour tablet computers at around CDN 300-400So you're faced with a few devices, plus additional options. Which to buy Here's a quick summary in order of cost.*** The entry level Kindle ***An entry level black and white (e-ink) book reader, it has a 6 inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books, and a battery which should last around 4 weeks.A terrific device to read books, and a worthy contender. For the technically minded, it has a 1Ghz processor and 4Gb of memory with an E-ink display. Essentially this means it's (a) Black and White (b) Fantastic to read even in bright sunlight (c) Requires very little power - hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours.*** New Kindle Paperwhite ***Launched in 2015, this is really an upgrade adding a super-sharp display with 300 pixels per inch - the same as the top of the range Voyage. The high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye, but battery life is reduced from 8 weeks of the original Paperwhite to 6 weeks - but still a very long time.Compared to the existing (2013) Paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and slicker than before, and a new Bookerly font plus better presentation of fonts on screen.If you have an existing Paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading. However, if you own a prior device, youll notice the huge leap in screen quality, contrast and performance.*** The Voyage ***Far more expensive that Paperwhite, this is thinner and 26g lighter. It has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e-reader body which makes it look more like a tablet, and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges. The back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand, and it has new Page Press buttons on the side to turn the pages. When the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback (nice touch). It has 4Gb of storage (same as the Paperwhite), and a similar battery which should last around 6 weeks on a single charge.Although it has the same sharp (300 dpi) screen as the Paperwhite, the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions. This means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright. In addition, youll find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness. To compensate, the Voyage automatically softens the light slightly. A lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device.*** Kindle Fire Tablet Computer ***The Kindle Fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the Kindle range. Similar to the Apple iPad mini, it has a high resolution screen, a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life - hours rather than weeks. Although you can read books on a Fire using the Amazon Kindle App, youll find the Kindle with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book. Youll find it produces less eye strain, and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web, watching videos and reading eMails, the Kindle is a dedicated book reader device.Unlike a Kindle, the Fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep. The Paperwhite and Voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back-light which is far more suited to reading in bed, and it wont for example, wake your partner if reading in the dark.Finally, unlike the rest of the Kindle range, the Fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use, its less useful on holiday. The Kindle range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books, and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight.What other options do I have----------------------------------Having decided upon the model (Kindle, Paperwhite, Voyage or Fire), the next decision is around:-* Special Offers - ie. adverts* 3G or WIFI connectionPersonally I have no issue with adverts on a Kindle. They only appear on screen when the screen saver is on, and are not at all distracting.The 3G option is a more difficult question. This effectively means you can use your kindle to buy or download books over-the-air instead of at home or near a WIFI hotspot. Personally I went for the WIFI model as the saving is considerable, but its a personal choice. Of course if you wont have WIFI at home, then youll need the 3G option.One point worth mentioning however, is if you have a modern smartphone, you can always create a Personal Hotspot or local WIFI signal that your Kindle (or indeed any other WIFI device) can connect to. Got to Settings Personal Hotspot on your mobile to set one up, and you can connect your WIFI only Kindle while youre out and about.Conclusion-------------If you love books but your on a budget, the original Kindle with WIFI and special offers is a great option. Youll still be able to carry thousands of book around with you, but youll lose out on the soft white back-light and super crisp display of the Papwerwhite.The Kindle Paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb 300 dpi super-sharp screen. Finally, theres the top of the range Voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness.If youre in the market for a Tablet Computer then the Kindle Fire range is worth considering, but youll get a better book reading experience on the Kindle. Myself I have both a Paperwhite and an iPad Air 2. I was skeptical at first, but the Kindle is a perfect device for reading with one hand (on the train), and the back-light and long battery life a huge bonus.Frequently Asked Questions---------------------------------Q: What file format will a Kindle readA: Kindle Format 8 (AZW3), Kindle (AZW), TXT, PDF, unprotected MOBI, PRC natively in addition to HTML, DOC, DOCX, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversionQ: What It doesnt support EPUB formatA: No - but you can convert your EPUB books using a freely available program called Calibre. Simple search for You Tube um0teoAR6zw and youll see a video explaining how to do this. Simples.Q: If I lose my Kindle, do I lose my books as wellA: No. All books are available on your Amazon account to download on a new device.Q: Can I save my place in the bookA: Yes. It will automatically save your place, and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position.Q: I often need reading glasses - can I adjust the font sizeA: Yes. Theres a range of fonts, and sizes to suit all tastesQ: Can I share books with my partner or childrenA: Yes. You can now share your books using Amazon Family Library to link two Amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire familyQ. Can I use a Kindle to read in bedA. Yes. But only on the Paperwhite and Voyage models. Its a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light. For the base Kindle model youll need the light onQ. Are there any free books availableA. Yes! Over 40,000 classic titles are available for free (out of copyright), and they can be legally downloaded. If you have a Amazon Prime membership you can also borrow a book from the Kindle Owners Library which includes around 60,000 books.Q: How long does the battery lastA: Depending upon model, you should get between 4 and 6 weeks between charges on around 30 minutes of reading per day. Ive certainly found Ive gone for weeks without charging the device Q: How long does it take to charge A: From absolutely flat, around 4 hours Q: How many books will the Kindle hold A: Literally thousands. You can also download every book youve ever owned from your Amazon account - so the list is quite literally unlimited. Q: Do I need anything else A: Youll need a smartphone charger or laptop with a USB socket as the Kindle range doesnt come with a charger (but the Fire does). Amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it. Some people also buy a cover, but I think this is not really needed. It adds to the weight, and is not really needed. It will protect your Kindle from a drop however, and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag."
13,BOTEGYTZ2T6WUJMM,7/20/2015,5,"I love my kindle! I got one for my fiance on his birthday, he loved it!!!!!!! so I decided to get one for myself as well and I am glad I did. It is very easy to read books in it. I LOVE the dictionary on this little device. Normally I just skip a word I don't know the meaning of and try to guess what it means in the context but with kindle, I just press and hold my finger on the word I don't know and translation pops up! so essentially, the meaning of a new word is at your finger tips! )If you love to read books, I highly recommend kindle.However, if you only read Manga or Comic books, if you are a fan of buying how to draw, how to sew books I do not recommend kindle for you. It is not easy to navigate trough pictures and slides.So if you are a fan of reading novels just buy it now!If you are a manga fan, just buy your manga books from bookstores."
14,SRTEH2FECMGNZJXJ,5/3/2014,5,"Exactly what it is supposed to be. Works great and I love the built-in light. Perfect reader, and very quick delivery."
15,SRTEH2FECMGNZJXJ,5/5/2014,4,"Only 4 stars because I found it very confusing at first. I had a Kindle before found it very easy to find what I needed to do. The user guide didn't really answer my questions, but I persisted am getting used to it. I really love the backlit screen no buttons to push to change pages. At first I wasn't sure about the smaller screen, but didn't take long to get over that. I'm sure I'm just a creature of habit not very techy. All in all, the Kindle Paperwhite is great."
16,ARPEGDHSXZJSHGSN,9/2/2010,4,"Almost like reading a real book. Don't is crisp, sharp and easy to read. I've held out from buying a reader for years because I could never quite get past the fact it wasn't a book. With this new kindle I don't even notice, I am immediately immersed. Wildly better than I expected."
17,ARPEGDHSXZJSHGSN,5/2/2014,4,"I already had an original Kindle Paperwhite and loved it. Buying this in addition seemed like a bit of an indulgence but I am so pleased I made this move. I love the new font and the clarity of the screen. I love that the Kindle comes to life when I open the cover (I bought a new cover with the magnetic clasp). While there is nothing dramatic about the evolving of the Kindle there are enough changes and improvements for me to feel I have made a great purchase which I am happy with. I also have a bunch of books from my Amazon.co.uk site which I access on my 'old' Kindle (I couldn't work out how, if at all, I can move books from one Amazon jurisdiction to another) so this has proved a good purchase all round."
18,ARPEGDHSXZJSHGSN,5/6/2014,5,Received my new kindle in perfect condition and I am very happy it is faster and a clearer it has a. bigger had drive at a good price and a fast delivery that you can count on you can not go wrongThank you
19,PSOEH3ZYYFETGCCD,5/6/2014,3,"The Kindle is my first e-ink reader. I own an iPad, an iPhone, and have owned a Windows-based phone in the past that I used as an ereader.My overall impression of the device is good.The good:I'd honestly rather read linear (read from page one to the end, one page at a time) fiction from it than a book, because I can't always get comfortable with a book. Hardcovers are sometimes a bit heavy, and paperbacks don't always lie open easily. The Kindle is incredibly light and thin. I can hold it in one hand easily. The page turn buttons are conveniently located. Page-turns aren't instant, but they're probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book (there are just a lot more page-turns unless you choose a small font). The contrast is better than other ereaders I've seen. There is zero eye strain in good light. My eyesight isn't the greatest and I like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses. I love being able to browse the Kindle store and read samples before deciding to purchase. The experimental browser is surprisingly usable, but isn't great. It is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs. The biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation, using the 5-way pad. It syncs your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iPhone or iPad.The so-so:The kindle store could use more categories and sorting options. You can't sort by top rated, and there is no category for alternate histories, for example. Finding a very-specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches, which don't do a great job. The wifi sometimes doesn't connect before it times-out.Read more"
20,PSOEH3ZYYFETGCCD,5/6/2014,4,"I'm a first-time Kindle owner, so I have nothing to compare the latest Kindle to. I don't own a Nook. I don't own an iPad (and, in any case, that's comparing apples to oranges). I don't have a Sony e-reader. 'This will be a short, simple review.I received my Kindle about a week ago and haven't been able to put it down.Things I like about my Kindle1. The e-ink display is amazing.2. Using the 5-way controller is simple and effective.3. Page turn speeds are faster than I thought they would be.4. It's lightweight, even with the attached cover (I have an Amazon cover with a built-in light)5. Page-turning buttons are quiet and well-placed.6. Recharge time is fast.7. I can order a book and start reading it in less than 60 seconds. Nice!8. Portability... I can take 3,000 books with me when I travel for work and not require additional suitcases or baggage fees.Things I'm not too keen on1. Buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly.2. Lack of individual number buttons is frustrating.3. Power button on the bottom Not a bad thing. Just an odd thing. (Same for the headphone input). I usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when I read.Things I hope change in the future1. How books are organized... When I put a book in a collection (which is actually a tag), it still appears in the main list. It's not actually moved, it's merely associated.2. The look of the main screen. I'd like folders or some other way to display collections.3. Ability to create personal screen savers.4. E-book pricing, though Amazon has little control over this.Read more"
21,PSOEH3ZYYFETGCCD,5/6/2014,5,"I woke up to a nice surprise this morning: a new kindle as a gift. I have an iPad and a Kindle DX, but I guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended-reading on. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my iPad and DX, but this new generation of Kindle is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time. The iPad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritates my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours. The DX was my go-to device for those extended/outdoor reading periods, but now I have a new friend for reading novels. Instead of a replacement, this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class. The iPad works great for web browsing, shopping, productivity, games, etc while the Kindle falls short in those areas. The Kindle works great for reading novels, where the iPad falls short. For those that love to do extended-reading of magazines, newspapers, research articles, etc, I find that the DX is the go-to device.Without a doubt, the size and weight of the new kindle is the biggest draw for me. It's smaller than the last edition by a significant margin. I've played around with the Kindle 2 and was impressed, but now looking at the size of the new Kindle, I'm blown away. It's the absolute perfect size. Smaller would be unmanageable and larger wouldn't feel nearly as good. This is a device that you can hold up, read, and just forget that it's there. Compared to other e-readers I've tried, it's much smaller and much lighter.One of my biggest complaints about the previous generation Kindles and the DX is the speed. It sometimes takes a while after you push next page' for it to actually change.Read more"
22,PSOEH3ZYYFETGCCD,5/7/2014,3,"UPDATE NOVEMBER 2011:My review is now over a year old, as is the Kindle Keyboard as Amazon calls it now. There are newer models: the basic, cheapie Kindle and the Kindle Touch, and of course the Kindle Fire quasi-tablet.Each of these models is an excellent choice. Whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences.The 3 e-ink Kindles are Kindle Keyboard (this one), Kindle Touch (the newest flagship model), and the basic Kindle. All 3 of them have EXACTLY THE SAME 6 DISPLAY, with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no eyestrain. The Kindle Keyboard is the oldest of these models, and I got one of the first ones when they came out in August 2010.I still absolutely LOVE my Kindle Keyboard and use it almost every day. I have read dozens of books on it. I like the newer models, they have some neat features, but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my 1-year-old Kindle Keyboard. Page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest Kindles, but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading, in my opinion.The touch-screen interface of the Kindle Touch is pretty neat. But, unlike my iPad, I only use my Kindle to read books, and reading books is just as nice on any of the current Kindle models. I don't consider the touch screen a must have feature, and I'm normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product I own.For that reason, I think the cheapest Kindle is an excellent choice.Read more"
23,PSOEH3ZYYFETGCCD,4/3/2014,5,I use to hate to read but now that I have my Kindle and I can change the size of the font so this old lady can see the words better I love to read.
24,SRTEH2FGBDJGX8FW,4/7/2014,1,"All of them quit working. There's absolutely no way to revive them once that battery loses power If NOT charged immediately, if even just a few weeks go by, NO HOPE of ever using your Kindle again. A major flaw"
25,SRTEH2FGBDJGX8FW,4/6/2014,3,"I recently ordered my 8th Kindle. It was to replace my 7th Kindle which I unknowingly crushed. I love the Kindle Keyboard as my clumsy old hands tremble too much to type on a touch screen. For me, newer is just more frustrating. However, new Keyboard Kindles are scarce on the ground, so I got a reconditioned one. I noticed on my account page that Amazon recognized my new Kindle as soon as I bought it. When it arrived, however, it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home WiFi. So I called my internet provider. I waded through that companys automated menu beginning with press 1 for English. That irritates me as I think English should be the default language in this country. But pressing on, I provided my 9 digit phone number, my 10 digit account number, my 9 digit zip code, my address, my 8 digit birthday, and the name of my favorite pet, my first car and my oldest nephew. Then I listened to an automated menu that had a 9 item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem I was having. After all this, I was asked if I would provide feedback after the call. I know this company and I was sure I would have comments to make, so I pressed 1 for yes. Then instead of finally letting me speak to a person, the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers I had already provided. Patiently I retyped all I had already typed. This time I was cannier. I refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection. Didnt I press 1 for English After struggling for several minutes I begged for a supervisor as I could not understand the English spoken by this person. I was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person I spoke to did not handle my problem. I asked for phone numbers every time so I could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally. Finally I found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my Kindle and my WiFi. I again asked for a telephone number in case I had further problems. Im sorry. I do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me. Well, I should have known. I had been on the phone for 50 minutes.Then my Kindle would not download my archived items. So I contacted Amazons Help Line. I got an American in the first minute. I did not have to press anything I explained my problem. The Amazon American fiddled with a few buttons on his end and my Kindle began working correctly. I was on the phone for 4 minutes."
26,SRTEH2FGBDJGX8FW,4/3/2014,5,Great. Love it.
27,SRTEH2FGBDJGX8FW,4/7/2014,3,"I researched the purchase of a Kindle for a long time. I couldn't decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e-reader. Boy am I glad I made this purchase. The downside to Amazon's online selling of Kindle 3 is that the customers don't get to see it in person. It is much better in person. This may sound stupid, but when I got my new Kindle, I thought there was a stuck-on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit's buttons, etc. I actually tried to peel it off. Doh! The e-ink on this unit is THAT good. I didn't realize that I was staring at the actual display. I also didn't realize that no power is required until the display changes. (thus the great battery life) I do a lot of reading, but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight. The new Kindle has been a godsend. Now, I can decide the size of type I need depending on my level of fatigue among other things. The weight and ergonomics are very good. For someone, like me, with neuropathy in his hands, it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own. To me, it is easier to read than print books. The ease of navigation is great as is the speed. The battery life, so far, has been extraordinary. It easily connected to our home Wi-Fi, which by design does not broadcast an SSID. It downloads books so fast that I almost thought they were not completely received. I did not buy the 3G version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where I live. If you are not constantly traveling, I don't see the need to spend the extra bucks, but that is a matter of personal choice. For those who have no Wi-Fi at home, remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via USB.Read more"

Books are so easy to get from the kindle itself It fits in her purse, I have to repeat everything , I always get, right after this chapter . Do not buy this for someone you want share LIFE with."
29,DIAEJ6Z8BEDTGGYY,4/7/2014,5,"I got my Kindle a few years ago and barely used it. Recently I discovered it again and have been using it daily, always in a hard protective case as it has been from day 1. Yesterday I opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked, seemingly for no apparent reason (no extreme temperatures, dropping, pressure, etc.). A quick Google search revealed this is a common problem, especially for my model, which made me think Amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw. Not a chance though. Despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative I spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product. Not sure it is worth the investment again - thinking it is better to stick to reading on my iPad, which is equipped with indestructible Gorilla Glass. Bottom line: do not buy a Kindle if you want a lasting product"
30,DIAEJ6Z8BEDTGGYY,4/7/2014,5,"It was excellent for me in one moment when I was able to use it onboard cruise ship while ship was in international water with it's own 3G or EDGE cellphone network. Once they stop this way of using around 5 months ago, now I can use it only when I am in the states."
31,DIAEJ6Z8BEDTGGYY,4/6/2014,4,"Bought for my husband for Christmas and I have to admit that I use it much more than he does, I love this product even though it has been updated with newer versions. I like to have something with just books. Easy to use, screen is easy to read, battery life long. I use it at the beach and for travel. Nice to have"
32,SSSEHFZ2TRZBAPF9,4/6/2014,4,It simply works even after 3.5 years of constant use. The battery is OK. Display looks the same. System is stable and reasonably responsive.

Since I had already been using Amazon Prime and Prime Music it was a no brainer for me to use the HDX to fill the role of media / web surfing on a tablet.Be informed about the download limitations to this device. Amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would-be purchasers make a more informed opinion. This wasn't as obvious as it should have been when I ordered mine so they're listening which is good.Be aware that their most popular Prime content *may* not be available to download (and save) to your HDX. You can save certain videos to your HDX but you won't know which ones until you buy an HDX and try it out. *** Edited 12/21/2013 You can now see a list of Prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device. That's an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable Prime content. +1 for Amazon. ***I was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you'd like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the HDX. Also NOT the case. So again, I bought the larger capacity HDX under this assumption. That was dumb on my part as it turns out because you're not limited by storage capacity. You're limited the NUMBER of downloads you can have on your device. Kids' content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation, but most people never will.Read more"
35,WSCEFUV4TVWT73ZB,4/7/2014,5,"Simply put, this is the Amazons iPad Air Killer. The 7 HDX is the iPad mini killer. Both HDXs inherent very similar hardware.

I work on my tablet around 4-5 hours a day (Email / Documents / Spreadsheet / PDF) use the tablet 1-2 hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books/magazine.

For comparison sake, I will use last year's Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and also the Fire HDX 7 as benchmarksSpeed (9/10):The same chipset is used on the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 as it is in the Kindle Fire 7 As I mentioned in the 7 review, this is leaps and bounds faster than last year Kindle HD. Last year Kindle struggles to go through any HD video content I put in. This year's HDX able to play seamlessly all the HD 1080p contents I added.

37,PPSEGFYAGD8FYUXV,4/7/2014,3,"Cons: 1. Built on Android does not mean you can have Google Play Apps. This is an unfortunate inconvenience, as there are some Google Apps that are just better than their Amazon App counterparts, and a few that I can not find within the Amazon Apps. If you want a fully functional tablet, then buy a tablet and download the free kindle app. If you want to pay more for something that does less, then the kindle is for you. This was a gift, so I will keep it, and continue to use my phone for the rest of my Apps that are not available on the kindle.2. Camera is less than perfect. Limited settings available. Again, I will use my phone for pics, the same scene with my phone showed the flames, with a small amount of glare. (Husband is a firefighter, so I take a lot of pictures of their exercises for their training.) An old Casio Exilim C721 phone with 5MP camera still takes better pictures at night.3. Kindle unlimited... I can not find anything worthy of paying a subscription price every month for. The Authors I want to read are not included.4. Amazon Prime... See 3, They doubled the price, and to me I just don't see anything there worthy of the cost, including Amazon instant video, no shows that I watch are included. Another family member did the 30 day trial, and was quite disappointed when his content disappeared after the trial.5. Youtube videos work ok, sometimes choppy, could be my connection or the device (computer playback worked fine when I had the time to test simutaneously).

The new device runs three times faster, is lighter in weight, and the battery lasts slightly longer. The sound quality on this device is excellent and the display quality is absolutely stunning. Below are some of the features to expect from the Fire HDX. BUILD QUALITY---There is NO blue haze on the 8.9 HDX.---The build quality is excellent.---Auto contrast is good (not buggy).---Operating system is very intuitive except after downloading free prime videos to watch offline.

There are major restrictions imposed on prime videos as listed below.---Not all Prime titles are available for download.---Most popular prime titles are NOT available for download.---There is a max of 25 titles that can be downloaded free at any one time.---Prime titles have a viewing period.---Viewing period is either 48 hours after you start watching the video, or 15-30 days (which ever comes first).---After the viewing period expires you need to reconnect to the internet.---Titles can be downloaded to only two separate devices at a time.---If you exceed the device quota then you must delete one of the titles before adding to another device.---There is no way to know which titles can be downloaded unless you have the HDX (amazon does not place a banner on the titles other than to say PRIME).Read more"
39,SRTEH2FF9KEDEFGF,3/17/2016,4,"Having received my Fire TV today, I've been trying it out for the past couple of hours.Setup was a no brainer. It required an update immediately so it did take about 15 minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple.The image quality (movies and games) is excellent. I've tried several movies from Amazon Prime and they look and sound nearly Blu Ray quality as far as I can tell.Navigation is very straightforward and it's generally easy to find anything you're looking for. Installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly.The remote works very well. I haven't played with the voice search feature much yet, but when I have tried it, it worked well. The buttons on the remote are well thought out and I prefer it to the Apple TV remote.I only have one gripe. As far as I can tell, there's no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for Amazon Prime members. This makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch. There are some categories that are limited to Prime (Most Popular on Prime, For Kids on Prime) I want to be able to just see what's available for Prime or at least be able to see by category what's available for Prime. I'm sure this isn't an oversight. I suspect Amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy/rent things but if they really want to compete with Netflix, they'll understand that we pay for our Prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently. A workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device.Perhaps I just haven't found the way to search for Prime available content. I hope that's the case or I will really be disappointed.Read more"

The Fire TV was easy to install and I'm loving all the features, free movies, music and simple interface - this thing even has a screen saver that comes on when you're listening to music! We've always just had our Comcast cable service without DVR and occasionally used Comcast OnDemand to watch/rent movies - but I'll never watch from Comcast again. The voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what I was looking for every single time I searched. It's just so easy to find what you're looking for (unlike Comcast), and since I'm an Amazon Prime member most of what I want to view is free - oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from Amazon is on average cheaper than Comcast OnDemand by a 1 or more. So happy with this purchase!"

We wanted to let you know that we made it easier to find your favorite Prime content with the click of your remote.

42,SHOEH3DZBFR88SCK,9/7/2016,3,"I am not a casual user of on-demand content and devices. Having tried smart tv's from 3 brands, smart dvd/bluray players, Apple TV, WDTV, HTPC, Chromecast and too many other competing products to mention--for streaming content, before this box you really had two options (for a simple to use box that doesn't require additional items or tweaking):First is Apple TV which is easy to use (interface) but Apple limits the content you can get greatly (including no Prime Streaming built in) and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow. The reason for selecting Apple TV is if you have other apple products that unlock features (like Amazon's content).The second option you could consider was Roku--which really means a Roku 3 box since it is heads and tails better than past Roku boxes in terms of remote and speed. Now Roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the Roku 3. It is for that reason you will see me address the Roku 3 so often in this review.I have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there.WDTV: Are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly.Chromecast: Is very cheap at 35 but requires other items to use (no remote included!), is limited to 16 channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via Chrome's browser not at the same quality level. This does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than FireTV/Roku/Apple TV. But if you can live with the short comings, it is worth a look at 1/3 the price of these devices.Smart TVs: Most of these are FINE for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes.Read more"
43,PSOEH3ZYDMSYARJ5,9/12/2016,5,I read all of the reviews of If you have the Fire HDX 8.9 don't buy this 10.1 tablet. The resolution is just as good on the 10.1 as the HDX. Starts up faster that the HDX. It's a nice size not a solid square like the IPAD'S. I saved myself 80.00 by buy the refurbished there is nothing wrong with it. I highly recommend this Kindle over than a high priced IPAD.

45,PSOEH3ZYDMSYARJ5,9/9/2016,4,This review is about the certified refurbished Fire HD 10 unit I ordered. It looked and acted like a new unit for 80 less. Still trying to decide if I want to give them back 15 to remove the obnoxious adds on the lock screen. They really aren't that bad.
46,PSOEH3ZYDMSYARJ5,4/23/2017,4,"I purposely waited almost 4 months before leaving a review. I wanted to see if any issues developed before leaving feedback. I was not disappointed. The refurbished fire arrived in perfect condition, no scratches or wear. I purchased a screen cover immediately to insure it would remain in good shape. After 4 months, it works like a champ. No issues whatsoever. VERY PLEASED and would not hesitate purchasing refurbished item again. Amazon has ALWAYS treated me superbly with any issues I might have with orders or returns."
47,SHIEHS7XJ954NRYY,7/27/2016,3,I've owned several different tablets. This one is by far the slowest. And I don't mean it's a little slower. I mean you have to wait up to 2 minutes sometimes for the apps to load onto the screen. Opening apps can be quick or take up to 3 minutes. I've had far more issues with this Fire than any of the others we've owned. If I had realized the difference in speed I would have kept my old one. It's definitely not work the larger screen. It's a crap shoot on a daily basis on how fast it will be. But even on it's fastest day it's significantly slower than the others.
48,SHOEH4KM2W3Z6EH5,1/13/2017,3,"I've had the Kindle Fire HDX 7 inch tablet for almost 3 years and when I compare it to the Fire HD 10, the earlier tablet comes out the big winner. I find the larger tablet considerably slower. Several apps load quite slowly. The battery is consumed much more quickly. Maybe this is not comparing apples with apples, but I had expected at least the same speed."
49,SHIEHS7XJ954NRYY,7/11/2017,4,Have had this probably 3 weeks. Wanted to be fair with my review. The battery in my Kindle Fire 8.9 HDX quit talking to the tablet so had to keep it plugged in to use it. Tried the Fire 8 first and just didn't care for how much smaller the screen was. Returned the 8 waited a bit and ordered the Fire 10. Amazon did give me a discount due to my problem with the 8.9. The Fire 10 in my opinion is no comparison to the 8.9. The apps with the 10 works more like smartphone apps. In the first three days it froze up 4 times. I wondered if it was doing this because I had too many apps opened. Once I started closing the apps I wasn't using I haven't had the tablet freeze problem. I do like the bigger screen on the 10 and the colors are sharp and the pictures clear. I also learned that the 8.9 was no longer being supported by Amazon and that meant no updates so eventually a replacement would have been necessary. Why Amazon stopped the 8.9 is beyond me but I'm doing ok now with the 10. If you get it give it some time.
50,SHOEH4KM2W3Z6EH5,4/1/2016,4,"I've had my hdx 7 going on 3 years, I love it! I needed a larger screen for my eyes, I'm so glad I went with the refurbished, I've only had to get used to the different op system. I don't use this for gaming or movies, I am an avid reader and this is awesome for increasing the size of the pages and font. I did have some problems downloading my books but that's just me and my lack of kindle tech it shouldn't take me too much longer to get used to this newer system."
51,SHOEH4GRSUBJGZXE,1/30/2017,4,"I have now owned 4 Kindles and just love them! My first one lasted for years and then died of old age and overuse. I had used it so much the printed keypads were all blank. I then got 2 Kindle Fires. I gave one to my daughter and kept the other. I have had no problem with the Fire once I broke down and read some of the direction, if all else fails. Other than operator error I have used it for over a year but it's too heavy for my old overused hands. Not heavy though. Books now give me problems. Even paperbacks. But I then bought the smaller, lighter new Kindle and loved it from the first. I carried in my purse a lot so it froze after a few months. I called customer support and they replaced it with a refurbished one. This time I bought a light weight cover for it. I don't like the added weight of the cover but in order for me to never leave home without it I have to protect it. I have had this one for months and have had no problems. I now have about 600 books awaiting my pleasure! I just looked the Kindles over again. I'm getting paranoid about my little Kindle and am considering having an on site backup although Amazon would get me one here in just a couple of days. Still giving it thought. Basically I love my Kindles and use both of my current ones for different apps."

53,SRTEH2FVUHAAVH9X,11/11/2016,4,I have the kindle fire but was frustrated when taking it to the beach. This model is easy to read on the beach and was easy to set up. You can't tell that it's refurbished - it looks brand new.
54,SRTEH2FVUHAAVH9X,11/17/2016,1,"DON'T BUY a reburbished Kindle. I've had to return them, twice. Apparently, Amazon's definition of refurbish is to take a Kindle with some problem or defect, simply repackage it and send out again to see if some different customer might take it off their hands.Both times, the 'refurbished' Kindles shorted out in different ways. The Kindles especially liked to misfunction while I was in the middle of working out at the gym."
55,DIAEJ6Z8KQFWDEGH,4/20/2017,1,"The refurbished Kindle looks brand new, I wouldn't even know that it was used. The only down side was that when I opened up the package, the Kindle was already on."
56,DIAEJ6Z8KQFWDEGH,1/12/2017,4,"Bought a refurbished kindle and literally after one month of owning it the device started to freeze. I had to reboot it multiple times and then it would start working. Went on a trip and it worked as it should but as soon as I returned the battery died and I charged it over night and the next morning the screen was frozen with the character reading a book under a tree. I tried all rebooting methods (20 seconds, 40 seconds, 1 minute) and nothing. Called customer service and was on the phone for an hour. Eventually they said that they could only give me 35 off the next purchase of a new kindle. I was pretty bummed out that a refurbished product of their own was not backed by them. I ended up buying a new kindle with the discount they gave me but should have just went with a new one to begin with since I ended up spending the same amount of money and had way more of a headache to deal with. Now I have to figure out what to do with this new Kindle Paper Weight that I have."
57,SRTEH2FVVKRBAXHB,6/29/2017,4,"Updated 6/617 - so useful we now have 3 of these along with the full sized echo Amazon Echo - BlackAfter using the full sized Echo for a couple of months thought it would be nice to expand on that one piece of hardware. I had no experience with the 'Dot' so i went ahead and shopped for the refurbished (a first as well.) The Dot arrived in a small plain box. Upon removal found the Dot to look just like new. No blemishes, scuffs, dings, nothing whatsoever to indicate based on appearance it was anything other than new. it comes with plug, usb charging cable.that said what matters most is how it functions. i was concerned being refurbished but no worries it worked just as good as new. the device works exactly the same as the full sized Echo. For myself the biggest difference was the addition of a 3.5mm aux out jack. While you can pair both this and its larger 'big brother' to any Bluetooth speaker i have a set of wired Bose headphones and needed that extra bit so i could use them too.how do the Dot full sized Echo compare differences are surprisingly few. as said the Dot has a 3.5mm jack so you can use it with any wired speaker, headphones or earbuds while the Echo does not. the Dot when listening to speech or low volumes other sounds very good and at the same volume level i could not tell a difference between either of the two. however at higher volumes the Dot struggles with the larger Echo easily winning out. otherwise but for appearance they both function the same.as for what the Echo or smaller version Dot can doRead more"
58,SRTEH2FVVKRBAXHB,6/29/2017,4,"I was very hesitant to purchase a refurbished unit, but the discount at the time of my purchase was too good to pass up. I was fully planning on returning it if there was the slightest sign of an issue. I have had this unit for about a month now, and it has worked perfectly since I received it. Like a brand new unit. If you can get this refurb for a substantial discount, I think it is totally worth the risk of not buying a new unit.Edit (07/08/2017): My original refurb'ed Echo Dot is still going strong, and I received my second refurb'ed Echo Dot yesterday. This second one is just as like new as my first one. The packaging is similarly like new. It has the same clear sticker covers surrounding it like a new unit, and I believe the power adapter, cable, and manuals are all actually brand new."
59,SBEEH3QGYGHFUEXN,6/30/2017,4,"This was a birthday gift from my daughter. (71st birthday--certified old guy) What might I do with an Echo I bought a 3 Kindle book on using an Echo. Later I discovered most of what is in the book is probably in the on board helps, but the book makes a nice linear presentation that does not make me guess what I need to search out, and a Kindle book makes it easy for me to make notes I can find later with ease.I am using my Echo primarily as a radio. In the early 1990s I worked on my German skills by listening to a lot of shortwave radio. Most of that is now on the Internet. I could listen on my smart phone, but that uses phone battery reserves. The Echo runs on AC power from a wall outlet. The little speaker is adequate for voice broadcasts. I listen for hours to German news magazines. I can also listen to some old favorite broadcasts from Radio Canada.We live where my favorite talk radio program comes in poorly due to another station very near on the dial. But, our WiFi reaches my garage workshop and I have clear audio through Tune In. (I am having trouble linking iHeart Radio, perhaps because my subscription is not paid.)When I have asked Alexa a question she sometimes tells me she cannot answer a question I thought simple enough.I did ask for some music and was surprised to find CDs I bought as gifts are in Amazon's cloud for me to hear over Echo. Nice!"
60,SBEEH3QGYGHFUEXN,6/30/2017,5,"Everything works pretty great, doesn't always catch what I say.. But definitely worth the purchase. I am very pleased."
61,SUDEJFBRVYEUZUDH,12/2/2016,4,"I'm totally enjoying my Echo Dot! I have it synced to my Google Calendar and am able to let Alexa tell me what's on the agenda for the day. I can quickly ask her to set a timer or an alarm and easily find out about the local weather. I also have it synced to my Pandora account but you have to be specific about a saved station name when you want to listen to Pandora. I really wish I could just say shuffle my Pandora stations. That would be awesome! The speaker on the Dot isn't as loud as I would like it but if I'm sitting close by, it's good enough I guess. I've seen an option to add an external speaker but I haven't gotten around to doing that yet. And my 6 yo grandson loves to ask her to tell him a joke! I live in a small town and am probably not able to utilize the full potential of Alexa but I'm not regretting my purchase."
62,SUDEJFBRVYEUZUDH,1/10/2017,4,This is a nice compliment to my echo. Connected to my bt speaker it is actually a step up and less expensive than the echo. If I had it to do over again I'd have bought 2 of the dots instead.
63,SBEEH3QGAYAEPRCG,11/19/2016,5,"I am updating my review from two months ago.. My initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it. Today I have been using the Tap and sling daily for over the last two months and I felt like I needed to modify my review. I originally did not recommend this product, but after living with it, and growing to like it, I am changing my recommendation.The truth is, the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe. I have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling. I think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall. Also, it has been sat into a puddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling.I initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock, but it isn't as big of a problem as I thought it would be. I just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it (leaving the top of the sling on). easy off and easy back on after.My only real lingering complaint would be the price. 20 for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive. I am increasing my stars by one. Really the price is the only thing keeping this from a 5 star for me. I have come to really like the sling. I have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it. That has eased my concerns about keeping it clean/safe while throwing it into a work bag.My original is below. Overall, I would (and have) recommended the sling to protect the Tap.Received the Tap and the Sling cover in the last 24 hours.Read more"
64,SBEEH3QGAYAEPRCG,3/17/2017,5,"Sling is simply awesome and so is the Amazon Tap!! My tap arrived this morning along with this sling and I am currently testing both products out as we speak!! This sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today!!One nice thing I like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition.. It provides great protection for the tap, which is what I needed it for.. My tap is going to be like a mini, portable Sonos for me.. It's going to be a speaker I take with me daily!! So I wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting dinged up.. Even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker, it still protects it from dings! The minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker... Taking the speaker to the beach, camping, hiking, to parties, I wanted something to protect it while in use!! This sling is going to do just that!!Another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag!! At first, I was afraid the silicone wouldn't be strong enough for that and would stretch.. Well so far, no issues!! I use a carabiner and attach it to my bag!! No stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me!Pros1.) Can access all buttons in the sling2.) Can charge with the sling on (Via USB port not dock)3.) Allows personalization of your Tap4.) Protects your Tap from dings and since my tap isn't for home use, this is great5.) I love the bright and vibrant colors6.) Silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging7.) Doesn't adversely affect sound qualityOverall: I do feel 20 for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap, I very happy with it.. I didn't buy my tap to sit still at home..Read more"
65,SBEEH3QGAYAEPRCG,2/7/2017,4,"Ok first things first, I also own a Echo and if you own a Echo you will love the Tap.Now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the Tap was voice enabled like the Echo. I happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through. Because the Echo is not meant to be a mobile device. It generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have. But the Tap is meant to be mobile, and therefore I am happy it's not a Voice command device. I would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it. So I actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature. I have the Echo on my kitchen counter and the Tap in my Studio office. And when I leave my office I just grab it and go.I bought this on sale for 89 and I went to the store and listened to many Bluetooth speakers. And while yes the charge 3 sounds better, all the charge 3 can do is be a Bluetooth speaker. While the Tap is so much more for less . And the Tap sounds Great. After looking online I was a little nervous that it would not sound that great, but I was 100 wrong about that. There is no other product out there for 89 that sounds this good and can do what the Tap does.I was not paid or given a Tap to write this review. I'm just a consumer who was it the market for a Bluetooth speaker, and I could not be happier with my choice.Also if you buy this device buy the Amazon sling as well. Trust me you will want it. And honestly I am again happy I got the one that covers the bottom of the Tap. Because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink I would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed.That's it, that's all. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!!!!!"
66,SWIEHF3H7WG6VGMR,11/21/2016,5,"I'm a huge fan of the Echo family. I have two Echo's, three Dots and one Tap. No they aren't essential to my life but I love playing music, listening to the news and controlling the Philips Hue smart lights throughout my home. It was a large investment that most of the population won't make - with that being said I am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck Dots look like. Glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them. Having the Dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic.Some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose - I'm not sure why people are moving their Dots. Since Dots are made to be stationary, have a loose fitting cover isn't an issue. To me, it fits perfectly. They also aren't made of real fabric, but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture. Not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your Dot happens to get sunlight.I bought three covers - Blue, Grey and White. They all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn't attract more attention than it needs to. With that being said, I like all three colors.Edit 07/11/2017 - These covers hold up well over time. Mine haven't collected dust or faded. I've kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue (not that I'd expect any besides possible fading)."
67,SWIEHF3H7WG6VGMR,5/21/2017,5,"I am thoroughly impressed with my Echo Dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs. a nerdy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop. The construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the Echo. This case/cover will give your Echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in, but still offer the great functionality of Alexa."
68,SBEEH3QGWRGG3J6Q,12/23/2016,3,"I love everything about this case except for how it fits on the Echo Dot. I was expecting a snug fit however, it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it (and the power cable is disconnected), the dot will fall out of the case."
69,SBEEH3QGWRGG3J6Q,6/21/2017,3,"Major fan, didn't buy this because of protection, bought it cause it will blend in to my decor. It is not a skin, so it's not skin tight. Yes it's loose but how often will you grab it and move it. Me maybe once every year."
70,PSOEH3ZXRTZJUVXM,6/25/2017,3,Like a previous reviewer mentioned it is fabric over hard plastic it is not a snug or tight fit. Good quality though.
71,PSOEH3ZXRTZJUVXM,7/5/2017,4,"Echo Dot in my GMC Sierra Denali. At first she was just there with no support. She sat in that hole with no protection. Shifting, jiggling not knowing what can happen. There has to be something I can do. I looked and search and what I found is the Fabric Case for Alexa. This is it! A support she will be happy to wear. No more accidental popping out, no more shifting and readjusting, she is finally safe."
72,PSOEH3ZXRTZJUVXM,7/14/2017,4,Changes the whole look of the Echo ... after i purchased i think i should have gone with the tan leather. But blue is my favorite color and it adds a bit of a pop to a mundane looking black disk! The texture is also really nice feel and look to it!
73,KTAEHE9HAED4VUQB,7/1/2017,4,A great looking cover for the Echo Dot. It gives the Dot a softer and more elegant look. I feel that it is a little pricy for what you get but I do not regret my decision to buy this case.
74,KTAEHE9HAED4VUQB,7/13/2017,4,This is perfect. A lot of people were commenting that the case falls off and it's not portable. That's not the intended use of the case. It is strictly for decorative use. It look great and comes in several color options. Would definitely purchase again.
75,SNDEH75ZFZ5REGFH,5/12/2017,5,"Over the years, I've tried a variety of cases for the various models of Kindle and Fire tablet that I've purchased from Amazon. While I've found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive, I found myself coming back to Amazon's own product when I purchased one of their new 7 Fire tablets, and I'm pleased with it.This is a very good quality cover, it fits well, and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation. It's made of fabric on the outside, with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed. It matches the color of the Fire tablet perfectly.My only hesitation in purchasing it was the price - the case all by itself is fully half the price of the Fire tablet! But I suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is, than how expensive the case is (kind of).Still, I decided to spend the money for this case. The tablet needs the protection and I know from experience that Amazon's cases are durable and will last for a long time (I've used my original Kindle Paperwhite - first generation model - with case since it was first purchased).I'll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet. I'm very satisfied with it."
76,SNDEH75ZFZ5REGFH,4/3/2014,4,"I typically don't post reviews however don't waste your money on this case. I got it on Friday and started using it that evening. Its now Thursday and the case is peeling at the edges, the fabric around the camera hole has started bubbling, and the felt on the inside edge is wearing off. i have not had any issues with it standing on its own like other people have mentioned. I am giving this a two star mainly because it is still functional. I am tempted to send it back but I like the functionality of this case."
77,SNDEH75ZFZ5REGFH,4/6/2014,5,All good A+
78,PTYEA6SFGD4X8NAR,4/7/2014,4,This case is very well made and sturdy. It perfectly matches the color of the tablet. I cannot figure out how to use the back as a stand. There is only one way it folds so it should not be that difficult. It does not work for me so I have given it a 4 star review.
79,PTYEA6SFGD4X8NAR,4/7/2014,3,It's pretty and matches my Fire tablet and I like that it's slim and doesn't add a lot of bulk to the tablet. It could be improved if it had a hand strap to make holding it easier but I bought a separate hand strap that fits with it.
80,PTYEA6SFGD4X8NAR,4/6/2014,5,"The case is cute and a nice color, fabric is nice, seems it will hold up. Problem is it doesn't stand up as described, mine doesn't stand up at all. Priced is too high for what it is in my opinion. I wouldn't buy this case again"
81,KTAEHE9KFCMVVSBN,4/6/2014,1,Great new Light Weight cover/case for my new Canary Yellow Kindle. I wanted the case to match my new Kindle. What a great choice. I am so happy with both the case the Kindle. So bright cheerful. Just like a sunny day.
82,KTAEHE9KFCMVVSBN,4/7/2014,2,"This case is great - it's inexpensive, slim and very sturdy! I have another Kindle Fire that's a little bigger so the case is somewhat heavy and bulky. in comparison - this case is very lightweight yet still protective."
83,KTAEHE9KFCMVVSBN,4/7/2014,2,"This case is overall quite nice, but has started to peel apart on the edges a little. I will try to update this review later on after I see how it holds up.The tablet automatically locks, and wakes the screen when closing and opening the case, which I think is the most appealing part about this case."
84,KTAEHE9KFCMVVSBN,4/7/2014,5,This is a great cover. It turns the device on and off by opening and closing and works as a great stand with it either vertical or horizontal. It also adds very little to the size or weight of the tablet. I absolutely recommend it!
85,KTAEHE9KFCMVVSBN,4/3/2014,4,I can read a lot longer without pain in my hands since the cover holds it for me. Very nice shade of blue.
86,KTAEHE9KFCMVVSBN,4/8/2014,5,Nice case that my daughter needed for her new kindle she earned. Nice and sturdy. Its actually better than I thought it would be and serves its purpose.
87,KTAEHE9KFCMVVSBN,5/2/2014,4,"All-New Amazon Fire 7 Tablet Case (7th Generation, 2017 Release), Charcoal BlackPerfect fit. I really like the case's simple clean design that lets you sit the tablet vertical and horizontal ."
88,KTAEHE9KFCMVVSBN,9/2/2014,5,works well with the amazon fire 7
89,KTAEHE9KFCMVVSBN,5/1/2014,4,"I bought this case at the same time I bought a new Fire tablet during Prime days. It was recommended on the tablet page, so I thought I was getting the right case. Well, it doesn't fit - not by a long shot. Then I realized the case was for a new Fire for 2017 (like mine) but 7th generation, not 8th. Since it does not fit, I now have to return it. And at my expense (arg!) I can't even exchange it for a new one because apparently Amazon does not make this case for the 8th generation Fire yet. You update one of your products, then release it, but you don't put out a case for it at the same time WTH Amazon When will you start selling Amazon cases for the Amazon Fire 8th generation I'm NOT happy with Amazon right now and am wondering whether I should keep the tablet if I can't get a case for it that has the vertical stand feature that the Amazon case has."
90,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,5/4/2014,5,Fits greatly with the device and easy to use. The fabric makes it look cool.
91,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,4/7/2014,4,"Horrible cover for my new (third) Kindle!!! And it seems to be the only option for the Kindle Fire 7 (cover fits 7th generation). The back side of this cover folds like origami paper. It bends too many ways, is too lightweight, and won't prop up or stay propped up well. You can't stand it up to read on a table with any reliability. Forget it in a real wind or if it gets bumped.Amazon should have given us a choice between a sturdy cover with strong sides that don't bend all over and another, cuter, flimsier cover that can be bent as desired, like this one.Maggie"
92,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,9/2/2014,2,"Still not really in love with the new Kindle itself (on the fence about returning it), but this case is just horrid. It says it stands, it doesn't. It just collapses no matter position it's in. It's flimsy and scratchy and does just about nothing. Complete waste of money."
93,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,5/2/2014,2,"This is a great case! It allows access to all ports and camera, while not taking from the protection of the tablet itself. It feels very durable, and I think it would protect the Fire well against accidental drops, bumps and scratches. As a blind individual, touch is very important to me. This product feels well made. It feels expensive, and I'm certain looks the same. The standing feature is great, it stands well for movie viewing or apps that do better in landscape. This is a great accessory for the new Fire 7. I'm sure there will be other companies making cases for it. But this is how the folks at Amazon envisioned their device, and it is amazing! Don't be fooled in to buying a cheaper product. Amazon devices do best with amazon accessories."
94,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,4/3/2014,4,"25 for a case for a product that costs 50. Typical scam from Amazon just a warning, in the process of returning both items seeing as the Fire 7 is a broken device. To transfer any data to it, you must restart replug the device for each file... even a 5 thumb drive can do more without an interface."
95,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,4/3/2014,3,"This works as a case, and matches the color of the kindle nicely. The main feature I wanted was the stand, however. It is only one corner flap, as pictured. I incorrectly assumed there might be slightly more technology involved. There is no stop or anything to keep it from going completely flat backward. Starting out, my kindle would sit at a nice 70 degree or so angle from the table, but now my kindle will sit at maybe 30 degrees off the table. Eventually it will just go flat. I've had it for maybe 3 weeks. If the stand feature is important to you, get a different case."
96,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,4/3/2014,1,"I liked the case but unfortunately I purchased the wrong one for my Kindle, my fault. Amazon, as usual, there was no problem getting a refund."
97,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,4/3/2014,2,"I'm loving my new Fire 7. I was looking for another Fire 6, and since it was not available and this 7 is only a little larger, comes in great colors, AND has Alexa - I was hooked and couldn't wait for it to arrive."
98,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,4/4/2014,5,"While this case fits a 7th Gen Fire perfectly, there is no comfortable way to hold it and it doesn't stand up on it's own for viewing. Returning to try another style"
99,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,9/3/2014,4,Good looking and works well. If you're having trouble standing it up vertically or horizontally check out Amazon's video (link below). My only slight quibble is that I find the Fire 7 slippery (it's fallen out of my hand) and I was hoping this case might have more of a grippy material.
100,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,9/2/2014,3,Fits beautifully - snug and sweet.
101,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,6/24/2014,3,Love the color of the cas and seems to protect well. Loving this case.
102,VANDZY4YZFPEG85T,4/29/2014,5,"This is a good case that provides adequate protection for your new 8 inch 2017 Kindle Fire. Inside it features a plastic frame that you snap your Kindle into. The frame solidly holds your Kindle into place and also covers the corners of the tablet and protects it during drops. The case weighs in at 4.66 ounces.The exterior of the case is a fiber cover that looks stylish. It is available in canary yellow, charcoal black, cobalt blue, marine blue and punch red. The one in my video is marine blue. The top cover has magnets in it that hold the cover closed and also tightly attach it to the back surface of the case when the cover is fully opened.The cover also has magnets in it that turn off the tablet when you close the cover and turn it on when you open the cover. I like that feature as it helps to conserve battery power. The inside surface of the cover is a micro fiber material and that protects your tablet screen from scratches when the cover is closed.I like that the micro SD card slot is covered when the tablet is installed in the case. That helps to protect the SD card from being lost or quickly stolen. A large memory size SD card can cost 47 to almost 100 and the added security is helpful.The tablets speakers are uncovered when the tablet is opened and when it is properly stood up in the landscape mode so you can watch a video. I show this in my product video. All of the top controls and ports are available while the tablet is in the case. That includes the volume controls, the headphone jack, the microphone, the power charging port and the power on/off button.The cover flap can be partially folded to allow you to stand the tablet into the portrait mode or in the landscape mode for reading, browsing the Internet or watching movies.Read more"
103,VANDZY4YZFPEG85T,4/3/2014,1,This is a horrible an overpriced case. I've had this case for less than two weeks and it's already coming apart. The little rubber stitching around the case is falling off
104,VANDZY4YZFPEG85T,4/30/2014,5,"As with other recent Fire covers by Amazon, the cover has a snap-in plastic shell that holds the Fire securely and will not let it fall out. (I've used plastic shells similar to this for years with my Kindles and Kindle Fires, and none of them has ever slipped out.)Another feature that I look for is Auto Wake/Sleep, which automatically wakes the tablet when you open the cover and puts it to sleep when the cover is closed. It's a very useful feature that helps to extend battery life, since you don't have to remember to hit the power switch when you close the cover. It's also a huge convenience feature.Other comments:* All of the Fire's ports and controls are on top of the Fire, which is open on the case. The speakers are covered, but when the case is opened, they're uncovered. Note that the cover does block the micro SD card port on the side.* The microfiber inside of the top cover helps prevent scratches to the display screen.* The front cover can be folded to act as a viewing stand. It's a nice feature, especially for watching videos.* With the cover folded back on itself, the rear camera is blocked. To use the camera, you'll have to keep the cover open. But honestly, how often are you going to use the Fire's rear camera, which at 2 MP is pretty lame."
105,VANDZY4YZFPEG85T,4/29/2014,2,"I have purchased several Amazon Fire cases in the past and have been delighted in the streamlined design and the vinyl covering. Very easy to keep clean. This new design for the fire HD 8 is FABRIC. How long do you imagine a yellow fabric cover is going to stay clean I cannot see any easy way to clean it, like I do with the vinyl covers. I bought one for myself as well as my Mother. I will keep them but I sure hope they don't turn around and produce vinyl ones after all the concerns I am sure will be coming. I won't be able to afford two more."
106,VANDZY4YZFPEG85T,5/2/2014,5,"Has the basics covered: Secure hold, access to all ports, camera etc. Folds flat and holds magnetically if you want to read, but dangles freely if you want to use the camera. Feels secure.Better than expected: Other Kindle cases have been a bit insecure when used as stands, especially in portrait mode. This one is quite secure.Worse than expected: The textured front cover looks fine and feels nice but any slight stain from kids' food crumbs and the like stains immediately and due to the texturing cannot be wiped off. Even a bristled brush left some noticeable residue on the pale yellow one. Word of advice - unless you are both an OCD neat freak and very careful where you put this thing down, go for a darker color. Expensive - what do you expect for a new captive device"
107,VANDZY4YZFPEG85T,4/30/2014,2,"I like the case for the primary reason that I bought it--to protect my new kindle, but as a stand it has its drawbacks. I am not comfortable at all with trying to use it in the vertical position, and in the horizontal it is stable enough for watching movies or videos, but at home I have another stand that I use if I am playing any of my games on the tablet. Good price, and I am pleased with it as protection for my tablet. Not near as pleased with it as a viable stand."
108,LJGEB2KMCMMHHFC7,4/4/2014,4,"1. While a great idea to make the cover self-standing, it's annoying that it's floppy when not in use.2. I bought the cover because my first Kindle didn't have a cover and often got left on, wearing down the battery. My second Kindle cover had the convenient feature of automatically opening and closing the device. So I wanted that feature on my third Kindle. Even though I think it's over priced, I like the convenience.3. My other cover was black, which often got lost on dark surfaces. This time I got the denim blue, so it's much easier to find from a distance."
109,LJGEB2KMCMMHHFC7,4/29/2014,3,"Fits well, the easel stand is a little flimsy and the Cobalt Purple is really blue, but for protection it works well."
110,LJGEB2KMCMMHHFC7,5/1/2014,3,"The case does what it is supposed to do. I think because I bought the tablet, Amazon should have reduced the price of case. Too pricey but I wanted a perfectly fitted case and not something that would or would not be compatible."
111,CRGE6A53UX7CJMXX,9/3/2014,4,"it's a nice color, it fits the fire8 very well, however, i cannot stand it on it's side, unless I reverse the fire8, and put the right side on the bottom. The stand does not work on it's left side the way the diagram shows."
112,CRGE6A53UX7CJMXX,4/10/2014,4,"My primary concern is the price when comparing to other solutions. Nevertheless, has received the and installed the product I believe that I meets my specific needs and expectation. This case is unlikely to protect my Fire HD in a 5-foot drop. It does, however, protect my kindle from spills and low drops. What I want and what I have is the ability to, without forethought, turn off the Kindle when the cover is closed to save power. Moreover, whether by design or oversight the fact that the SD Card is covered (e.g. you need to remove the case to access the SD slot) this is a good thing. All in all I am impressed with product 's fit (e.g. the camera hole is perfectly aligned.), the tablet speakers are well positioned for audio and the case folds into both landscape and portrait support positions,Bottom-line I'm happy with the purchase and can recommend it to others for consideration."
113,CRGE6A53UX7CJMXX,4/4/2014,5,"I've had the new Fire HD 8 with the case for about a week. I use it exclusively for reading and listening to audiobooks. So far my only issue with the tablet is the volume drops when the cover is closed. Why is that There is no reason I can think of why my volume needs should change because I closed the lid. BTW, the marine blue is lovely. The speakers are located along the left side of the device so when you close the table case the sound quality which is already mediocre, is noticeably diminished. This is a design flaw that needs to be fixed. I purchased this tablet to replace an impaired ipad mini. For the price, the Fire tablet is a reasonable replacement."
114,CRGE6A53UX7CJMXX,4/29/2014,4,"As a Kindle case, this works, but it's got a few too many negatives.To the good, it's nice and thick, meaning it gives good protection, and your Kindle snaps into it rather than just sitting in it like my 7 HDX's magnetic case, meaning your Kindle won't fall out if you tip it too far.However.1. I hate the flap this has for propping it up. Maybe I was spoiled by my last Kindle's case, but I had one of the magnetic origami ones, and the case folded into a very solid support that would hold the Kindle up on either of the long sides. This one's flap isn't magnetic, and it's just one diagonal fold, which makes gives far less support. The thing tips over or collapses more than I'd like it to, and if I want to read in landscape orientation (i.e. the long sides go left to right rather than up and down), the top and bottom aren't interchangeable. That wouldn't normally be a problem, but...2. There's a camera on the back of the Kindle 8, and the case has a hole for it. The problem is, there's only one hole, which means there's a right way and a wrong way to put the Kindle into it. Like I said, none of this would normally be a problem, except I sometimes use it while it's charging, and my outlet is on the left side of the bed. Naturally, the stand puts the USB thing on the right side of the Kindle. Assuming I don't want to cover the camera, I can either prop it up while I read, or let it charge while I read, but not both. (I'll probably order a longer USB cable, but the one the Kindle comes with is too short to wrap around to the other side.) I wish they'd punched two holes in the back and given us options for which direction the Kindle fits.3. It's got a canvassy sort of fabric covering rather than a hard plastic one like my last case.Read more"
115,KTAEHE9KEZBBQHYA,9/2/2014,5,"Good cover love the standing feature, one big flaw.... It need cut outs for the speakers when shut....Music still plays when active and cover closed to protect screen but there are no cut outs for the speakers thus destroying the sound..... This is a huge design flaw for the case."
116,KTAEHE9KEZBBQHYA,4/4/2014,4,"In this day and age of rectangles with screens being covered in various ways, its perplexing that you can mess up something as basic as this. It covers the Fire fine. The fit is snug and snaps into place no problem. A hidden magnet auto-wakes/sleeps the display when you open/close it. The fabric collects cat hair like a pair of cheap black pants. Yet worst of all is the fold on the back does an awful job of propping up fire when you want to use it hands free. You can get it to stay, but it often slides out, or just puts the fire at a slightly weird angle. Whether it's in portrait or landscape orientation, the stand on the back is so wonky, that you're better off just using a jar of peanut butter and a couple pieces of chewing gum to get it to stay in place."
117,KTAEHE9KEZBBQHYA,5/1/2014,4,"Over the years, I've tried a variety of cases for the various models of Kindle and Fire tablet that I've purchased from Amazon. While I've found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive, I found myself coming back to Amazon's own product when I purchased one of their new 8 Fire HD tablets, and I'm pleased with it.This is a very good quality cover, it fits well, and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation. It's made of fabric on the outside, with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed. It matches the color of the Fire tablet perfectly.My only hesitation in purchasing it was the price - the case all by itself is nearly half the price of the Fire tablet! But I suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is, than how expensive the case is (kind of).Still, I decided to spend the money for this case. The tablet needs the protection and I know from experience that Amazon's cases are durable and will last for a long time (I've used my original Kindle Paperwhite - first generation model - with the Amazon leather case since it was first purchased).I'll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet. I'm very satisfied with it. Notice how the speakers are visible at the top of the tablet when it is propped up in landscape mode."
118,KTAEHE9KEZBBQHYA,5/4/2014,3,"When I purchased my Kindle Fire HD 8, this was the recommended case at checkout. I purchased it thinking that an Amazon sourced cased should work and fit well. I'm very happy with my choice of this case both with its style/look and function. The price is much lower than that of the case in which I keep my Kindle Paperwhite but is still fairly expensive given the cost of the Fire.To my match my black Kindle Fire, I chose the charcoal black version which is actually a tweed style look in various shades of gray and black. It has the look and feel of fabric versus the plastic covers I have used on my Paperwhite. The inside is a black microfiber cloth for screen protection. It does not have an internal pocket. My Kindle Fire fits securely in the plastic shell and can stand both landscape and portrait with a flip of the case.The case has a magnetic cover which keeps it shut or open without the front cover having to be held manually in place. Whether the case is open or closed, the ports for charging, the MicroSD port and headphones as well as the control function buttons are exposed. When it is closed, the cover covers the speakers and the front facing camera lens. When the cover is fully open and folded to the back, the rear camera lens is covered (the front facing lens is fully exposed when the case is open.) If you wish to use the camera for photos or video while it is in the case, you can hold the front cover in your off-hand while it is in use.As I have a tendency to leave my Paperwhite on (and run down the battery fairly regularly), I appreciate that this cover automatically turns itself off and on when you close or open it."
119,KTAEHE9KEZBBQHYA,4/3/2014,4,"This is an improvement over the Origami case we purchased for my husband's old 2013 Fire 7. He liked the case but the way it would collapse into several sections when trying to close was frustrating for me. This one has only 2 sections, so the folding issue is very minimal and it stands up well in both landscape and portrait as long as the tablet is in the correct orientation. (Just give the tablet a 180 if you can't get it to stand.) I don't usually like blue, but the marine blue of this cover and the tablet is gorgeous and they match perfectly. There is a nice texture to it that helps immensely with the grip as well as being very attractive. The cutouts are precise and allow for charging without removing the cover. I often have difficulty with close fitting hard plastic cases, but I had no trouble removing this one when I needed to. The only downside is that it does pick up a bit of lint at times. Overall, a very nice, classic case."
