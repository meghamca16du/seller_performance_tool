4,SWIEHF3EF5PZAZUY,6/16/2017,4,Arrived in Canada in less than a month with ePacket. Fits good and feels nice. Fairly thin material but doesnt show through. Lots of stretch to it.
5,SWIEHF3EF5PZAZUY,8/11/2016,3,"Though the fit was perfect, colour of the t-shirt came off on washing. No washing instrctions also given. "
6,SWIEHF3EF5PZAZUY,7/8/2015,1,Had black marks on the shirt . I will return it. Looks like second-hand clothes.
7,SWIEHF3EF5PZAZUY,9/1/2015,2,Material is nott cotton. Order for L i guess received small size ..Or may be my bad ..overall cute print ..true to picture
8,BOTEGYTZ2T6WUJMM,7/3/2015,1,I don’t like it. It’s not at all what I have imagined. I always buy M in T-shirt’s because I like to wear a little loose T-shirt. But this is too tight for a size M.
9,BOTEGYTZ2T6WUJMM,8/8/2015,5,so happy with this buy :) I highly recommend buying this.

91,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,4/7/2014,3,The colour of the dress was excatly like the picture. It was delivered on time. Loved the packaging. 
92,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,9/2/2014,2,The dress arrived really late. It left me no time to try it for any fittings. Really disappointed with the delivery service!

94,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,4/3/2014,4,Took awhile to recieve but I am blown away with the quality it is my dream dress!! Thank you so much!
95,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,4/3/2014,1,The lace of the dress came out as soon as I wore the dress. It was really embarassing. The stiching of the garment was so untidy. Spoiled my  special occassion and my mood. 
96,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,4/3/2014,1,The dress was very uncomfortable. i just can't sit or stand properly in the dress. It is very irritating. Also the delivery took ages.

99,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,9/3/2014,5," It looks like the dresses you will find in bridal shops but at a fraction of the cost. It looks expensive and luxurious. Plus service is really amazing, they were very prompt in communicating and sent the dress on time. No wonder this dress gets so many orders. Its my best buy for my wedding."
100,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,9/2/2014,3,"Though the colour and fit was perfect, the material is quite delicate and can be easily destroyed."
101,SKTEC88WSNYJKWY7,6/24/2014,3,The length of the dress was short. Could not fit me well. 
102,VANDZY4YZFPEG85T,4/29/2014,4,"elegant dress!!! tailored good, stretch fabric slightly. sleeve with nice embroidery. looks elegant and expensive."
103,VANDZY4YZFPEG85T,4/3/2014,2,"I had to call again and again to ask details about the delivery of the dress. There was no response in the initial times. The process of ordering was in itself very irritating. On the top of it , when the dress arrived, its color looked faded. "
104,VANDZY4YZFPEG85T,4/30/2014,5,"beautiful dress, high quality sewing.From this seller I am buying the third time, the quality is perfect, the models too. All the dresses are well made. I really liked this dress, nicely hugs the body."

108,LJGEB2KMCMMHHFC7,4/4/2014,5,"The detailing on the back is just awesome. Excellent, much better than I expected!"
109,LJGEB2KMCMMHHFC7,4/29/2014,3,"Just like on the picture, beautifully made, feels and looks expensive. The seller lovely, sent the order super fast- I had the dress in a week and it traveled across the world."
110,LJGEB2KMCMMHHFC7,5/1/2014,2,"ven though everything is perfectly fine with the dress, the packaging was very poor, so anything could have happened to the dress. Simce the dress is soo expensive, a good packing was expected which was not done. Disapponted with the packing!"
